As it is, he can be found on the water with a rod in hand and a smile on his face approximately 300 days a year -- in Panama, the Pacific Northwest, the Louisiana Gulf Coast, Russia and other locations. A former member of Fly Fishing Team USA, Andrews is now a fishing guide who has a passion for the sport that, well, can accurately be called an obsession. Whether trolling bait for marlin, casting plugs for dorado, or busting fly tackle on epic yellowfin tuna, Andrews' desire to find and catch the biggest fish is limitless, as are the accompanying stories and adventures that he shares in this series.</desc>

As it is, he can be found on the water with a rod in hand and a smile on his face approximately 300 days a year -- in Panama, the Pacific Northwest, the Louisiana Gulf Coast, Russia and other locations. A former member of Fly Fishing Team USA, Andrews is now a fishing guide who has a passion for the sport that, well, can accurately be called an obsession. Whether trolling bait for marlin, casting plugs for dorado, or busting fly tackle on epic yellowfin tuna, Andrews' desire to find and catch the biggest fish is limitless, as are the accompanying stories and adventures that he shares in this series.</desc>
